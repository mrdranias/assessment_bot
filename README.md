# üöÄ Project Kickoff: Knowledge Graph-Driven Assessment Bot (ADL/IADL) 

## Vision
Build a production-ready, containerized chatbot platform that guides users (patients or clinicians) through structured clinical assessments (ADL & IADL) using a **knowledge graph** for flow control, full-stack modern Python/LLM techniques, and interactive dashboards.

---

## Key Features & Tech Stack

- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j graph database represents assessment domains, questions, answer options, and sequential flow (IADL ‚Üí ADL).
- **Conversational AI**: LLM-powered chatbot (OpenAI API or local Ollama/Deepseek LLM) interprets free-form answers and maps to clinical scores.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Provides API endpoints for session management, assessment scoring, and audit.
- **Gradio UI**: Clean, responsive chat interface and dashboard visualizing progress and results.
- **PostgreSQL DB**: Stores patients, sessions, responses, scores, and chat logs for audit and analytics.
- **Containerized**: Docker Compose for reproducible local and cloud deployments.
- **Shared Python Module**: Single source of truth for clinical data (question text, scoring, etc.)‚Äîused to seed both Neo4j and Postgres.

---

## Problem to Solve
How can we use **knowledge graphs** to drive dynamic, auditable, and customizable clinical assessments‚Äîwith full conversational logging, scoring, and UI‚Äîall in an open, reproducible stack?

---

## What‚Äôs Done / What‚Äôs Needed
- Initial clinical data module and schema defined
- Base Docker Compose and service structure in place
- Need help with:
    - Graph database best practices for assessments
    - LLM prompt engineering and NLU pipeline
    - FastAPI and UI/UX polish
    - CI/CD for deployment

---

## Why This is Cool
- Mixes graph reasoning, NLP, and conversational UI
- HIPAA-aware, extensible to other assessments
- Great for research, clinics, and demoing modern Python/AI

---

## How to Get Started
- Clone the repo, check out `/shared/clinical_assessment_data.py`, and run the seed scripts!
- Propose ideas for improvement, submit PRs, or request issues to claim

**Let‚Äôs build a state-of-the-art, knowledge-graph-powered assessment bot‚Äîtogether!**




# üåÄ ADL/IADL Knowledge Graph Chatbot

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This project aims to **combine knowledge graphs and large language models (LLMs) for intelligent administration of standardized assessments**‚Äîspecifically, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. The chatbot will initially use the OpenAI API (GPT-4o), but the architecture is designed for **easy migration to local LLMs** (e.g., via Ollama/Deepseek/LM Studio), leveraging the flexibility of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

**Key innovation:** A knowledge graph encodes assessment flow and scoring rubrics, enabling the LLM chatbot to conduct adaptive, accurate, and explainable evaluations in natural conversation.

---

### **Project Goals**
1. **Inject knowledge graph context into LLM prompts** to guide assessment flow.
2. **Use LLMs for NLU:** Convert free-text user answers into structured assessment scores.
3. **Dashboarding:** Visualize assessment results for users and clinicians.
4. **Patient Data Tracking:** Persist all results securely and accessibly.
5. **Measure response similarity and latency** across multiple LLM runs.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Concept**
- **LLM-Driven Test Administration:** An LLM (OpenAI or local) conducts assessments in natural language, guided by graph-derived prompts.
- **Knowledge Graph Backbone:** Assessment items (questions, scoring, logic) are nodes and relationships in a Neo4j graph.
- **Intelligent Navigation:** The LLM follows the graph‚Äôs flow to ensure all required domains are covered.
- **Full-Stack Integration:** User interaction, scoring, and data storage are modular, containerized, and reproducible.

## üéÆ **User Experience Flow**

1. **Start Assessment:** User begins the chat‚Äî"Let's start your ADL assessment!"
2. **Graph Navigation:** The bot queries Neo4j for the next relevant question node.
3. **Conversational Input:** User replies naturally; bot follows up as needed.
4. **Answer Extraction:** LLM parses response and assigns a structured score using criteria from the graph.
5. **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar, status messages, and ability to resume.
6. **Results Summary:** Final dashboard with total scores, per-domain breakdown, and export options (CSV/JSON).

## üöÄ **Future Directions**
- Add multi-hop reasoning or intervention suggestions from the KG
- Support more assessments (MMSE, MoCA, custom flows)
- Enable secure, multi-user support and audit trails
- Research bidirectional KG-LLM updates (e.g., KG enrichment from new responses)

## üìù **Project Principles**
- **Open Source, Reproducible:** All code and data structures in version control.
- **Privacy First:** No PHI in test deployments; all patient data is for demo/dev only.
- **Migration Ready:** Easy transition from cloud to local LLMs.
